# Handwritten-Alphabet-Recognition

**Tools and Techniques Used:**
This project utilizes Python programming language along with the following tools and techniques:
- OpenCV for image processing.
- Pandas for data manipulation.
- Matplotlib for data visualization.
- Scikit-learn for data preprocessing and model evaluation.
- Keras for building and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
- Google Colab as the development environment.
- Google Drive for data storage and retrieval.
- Kaggle for dataset acquisition and management.

**Task of the Project:**

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:**
   - Loaded a dataset of 370000 containing images of handwritten alphabets in CSV format.
   - Preprocessed the data, reshaped images, and prepared corresponding labels.

2. **Model Development:**
   - Designed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using Keras for image classification.
   - Compiled the model with the Adam optimizer and categorical crossentropy loss.

3. **Training and Evaluation:**
   - Trained the CNN model on the prepared dataset, optimizing for accuracy.
   - Evaluated the model's performance on a test set, monitoring accuracy and loss.

4. **Prediction and Visualization:**
   - Applied the trained model to predict handwritten alphabets on an external image.
   - Visualized predictions along with the original image using OpenCV and Matplotlib.
